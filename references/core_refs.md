# Core conceptual references

This repository is not derived from any single prior framework but sits at the intersection of several lines of work where information, compression, and emergent structure play a central role.

- **Jürgen Schmidhuber**  
  - Work on algorithmic information theory, compression, and the „world as the output of a simple program“.  
  - Emphasis on compression as an optimality principle in learning systems.

- **Stephen Wolfram (2020, Wolfram Physics Project)**  
  - Proposes that spacetime and particles emerge from discrete graph-rewrite rules.  
  - Shares with SHG the idea that geometry and dynamics are secondary to an underlying informational update process.

- **Carlo Rovelli (Relational Quantum Mechanics)**  
  - Advocates that physical states are relational and do not pre-exist as absolute properties.  
  - Resonates with SHG’s view that definite outcomes appear only at the “compression boundary”.

- **João Magueijo & Andreas Albrecht (1999, varying speed of light cosmologies)**  
  - Explore models where the effective speed of light may differ in early cosmological phases.  
  - SHG generalizes this intuition in terms of coherence-propagation in the Infostream.

- **Nick Bostrom (Simulation argument)**  
  - Does not specify internal physics, but frames reality as potentially computational.  
  - SHG can be viewed as one way to specify internal informational dynamics in such a setting.

These are conceptual neighbors, not foundations: SHG remains an independent interpretational proposal.
