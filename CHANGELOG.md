# Changelog — Seamless Hourglass Model


## **v1.4 — Public‑ready draft (current)**
- Unified terminology (Infostream, compressivity, coherence pressure).
- Strengthened definition and interpretation of expected outcomes.
- Prepared documents for public repository release.

## **v1.3 — State at the beginning of this context**
- Clearly formulated **compression** as the core function of the Infostream.
- Completed **SHG + QM** section (superposition as pre-compression, collapse as re-compression).
- Completed **SHG + GR** section (geometry as expression of compression cost).
- Completed **SHG + Cosmology** section (cosmic expansion, early-era low-correlation regime, variable effective coherence-propagation rate).
- Formulated the hypothesis of the speed of light as an apparent invariant emerging from joint projection of space/time axes — a constraint on how the Infostream encodes coherent propagation, not a primitive velocity constant.
- Completed **SHG + Evolution** section (coherence-driven complexity gradients, compression-shifts enabling selection dynamics).
- Added **Relevant References** section linking SHG to information-theoretic, relational, and VSL-cosmology literature.
- Added the first coherent version of the *Coherence Pressure Test* as a potential empirical probe.

## **v1.2 — Introduction of the axiomatic layer**
- Introduced **Infostream** as the ontological foundation.
- Added the **coherence pressure** hypothesis.
- Shifted from metaphorical outline to structured theoretical model.

## **v1.1 — SHG as an interpretation of quantum mechanics**
- Formed the conceptual core: SHG as an informational interpretation of QM.

## **v1.0 — Philosophical origin of the model**
- SHG originated as a metaphor of "trajectory selection" in evolving reality.
- First appearance of the Seamless Hourglass idea as the intuitive root of the model.
